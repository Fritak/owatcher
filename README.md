# Owatcher

This app lets you check if you got into the overwatch game.

NOTE: The app, at this moment, isn't running on background, so you need to have the application opened, otherwise you won't get notified.

## Getting Started

Download *.apk (see releases)

To get it running, please download Owaiter app: https://github.com/Fritak/owaiter

### Prerequisites

At this moment the app is running only on an android phone, external *.apk. It should be "easy" to get on ios, any help is appreciated.

### Running

In the app Owaiter generate Qr code and scan it with Owatcher, it should work afterwards.
